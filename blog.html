        <p id="paragraph1"><a name=thisLine>Technology is the invention that has made our life easier and meaningful. We are no more in stone age just because of the technology. Technology is not limited to one sector but it's use is in different sector like: business, agriculture, communictaion, transportainon and many other uncountable sector. Since, we are all surrounded by technology, the top five technology I mostly use in my day-to-day life are listed below. </a></p>

        <h2 id="header2">1) Cell Phone</h2>
        <p id="paragraph1" style="color: white; margin-left: 100px; margin-top:5px; opacity: 0.9; ">
            It's the most obvious choice of technology that everbody uses in their daily life and same goes with me too. Cell phone has made my life easiest in the way that I am always connected to my near one's if it's through call or social site. Unlike wired phone, I can carry it anywhere I go. I will call cell phone a technology with collection of all the other possible internet technology. What can we not do with cell phones!,almost everything.</p>

    <div class="laptopContainer">
        <h2 id="header2" style="color: black; padding-top: 60px;">2) Laptop </h2>
        <p id="paragraph1" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-top: 20px;"> Laptop is the another technology I always use in my daily life. As I have to do my assignments and many other stuffs, laptop is always in use. I don't only use laptop for assignments but also for surfing other websites. And hey, I also use it for playing games.</p>

    <div class="internetContainer">
        <h2 id="header2">3) Internet Technology</h2>
        <p id="paragraph1" style="color: white; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 100px;"> Internet should be in my number one list that I use in daily life. But, anyway it's always a first and foremost thing in my life. I consider internet as the father of technology. Just like different technology, internet has also covered different sectors. I don't have to go to shop, restaurant or even in bank as just in one click all the things gets delivered in my house.<br>
     
        <br> It has also covered communication sector which includes gmail, skype, Whats app etc. and in which I mostly use gmail so that I don't miss out my important inbox. Not only is internet for communication but it can also be used as storage of files and folders. For eg: google drive,cloud storage etc. What can we not do with internet!? Feeling alone?... There's dating app for you!. <br>

        <br>That was just a random example. There's lot of thing we can do in the internet.

    <div class="calculatorContainer">
        <h2 id="header2" style="color: black; padding-top: 60px;">4) Calculator </h2>
        <p id="paragraph1" style="margin-left: 110px; margin-top: 20px;">Calculator is the technology I used before mobile and laptops and still use it whenever I have to do some mathematical calculation. From school level to till now I have been using calculator as in fraction of second all the complex problem gets easily solved and hence has been a most benificial technology.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="calculator" style="float: right; margin-top: 200px; margin-right: 40px;">
        <img src="calculator.jpg" width="400px" height="250px">

    <div class="camera"  style="margin-top: 230px; margin-left: 50px; display: inline-block;">
        <img src="camera.jpg" width="300px">
    </div>
    <div class="cameraContainer">
        <h2 id="header2">5) Camera</h2>
        <p id="paragraph1" style="color: white; margin-left: 90px; word-spacing: 6px; margin-top: 40px;">Something interesting is happening?....Capture it!<br> Feeling bored?....Capture yourself!. This is how I use camera on daily basis. It is fun to use and also useful as it treasures every moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusionContainer">
        <p id="paragraph1" style="margin-left: 80px;"> The use of technology is unmesaurable as technology has covered all the sectors. The use of technology in daily life is also unmeasurable and without it person feels miserable. Technology is a boon and curse. If utilized properly it's a boon else it's a curse.</p>
